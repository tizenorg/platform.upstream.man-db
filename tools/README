Many of the files in this directory are used internally by man-db's build
system. The rest are as follows:

chconfig:	Converts a man-db configuration file to the FHS.

checkman:	Can be run to inform of manual pages duplicated across
		hierarchies.

mandb_fmt-script: 
		An example of a per manual page hierarchy formatter
		script.

mkcatdirs:	Can be used to create all of the required cat directories
		after installation.
